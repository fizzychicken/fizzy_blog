<h2 id="Who-am-I"><a href="#Who-am-I" class="headerlink" title="Who am I?"></a><a href="#who-am-i">Who am I?</a></h2><p>I am James Cameron, a 45 year old IT Professional, born in Manchester England and now living in Auckland New Zealand. An Engineer at heart, I daydream about simplicity and complexity in equal measure. Known to be risk-averse, security focused, efficiency obsessed and persistent. A lover of puzzles, problems, stories, randomness and the unknown. An avid dunker of biscuits. Always looking to improve upon current-state and embrace change. I am willing to guide and be guided. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://img.fizzychicken.com/my_son_is_the_handsome_one.jpg">A father of one</a>. </p>
<h2 id="What-do-I-want-to-do"><a href="#What-do-I-want-to-do" class="headerlink" title="What do I want to do?"></a><a href="#what-do-i-want-to-do">What do I want to do?</a></h2><p>I am looking to combine my past experiences and pivot to being focused on leadership rather than direct development. While I will forever tinker with engineering, I am finding more and more satisfaction from mentoring others to achieve a group led outcome. I would like to combine my technical leadership, relationship management and collaboration skills to be able to deliver positive contributions to an organizations strength and culture. I hope to contribute, and help others contribute, to all stages of the product life-cycle, from design, to developmet, to delivery, to support, and beyond.</p>

During my time my role has changed 5 times and the company itself has changed 3 times. Originally employed at ASB, my position moved internally to the Insurance arm at Sovereign which in turn was eventually acquired by AIA. This has meant that I have had the ability to work on unique projects including technology stack migrations, repatriations, consolidations and Cloud transforms. During my time as a lead developer I helped create and improve critical business functions. I led mass data migrations and transformations and created robust processes and improvements whilst ensuring security and integrity. While my skill-set is historically focused on ECM and Integration, my wide range of skills and ability to quickly problem-solve has led to my exposure and involvement in many areas of the business. I pride myself in the quality of my communication above all things. I am also the technology On-Call engineer.</p>

I also own more bicycles than one person needs. I dream about being a better cook and gardener than I am. As a life-long gamer, no longer able to keep up with the reaction times of the young and talented, I get the most excitement from showing my son all the games that I have enjoyed throughout my life, and seeing him realize his own favourites.  </p>
